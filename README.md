This repository contains the solutions for the three CodeLabs assigned during the semester, along with the final project: Chess Opener.

The final app I developed is designed to help chess players randomize their opening moves when playing as White. The goal of this app is to help players discover new chess openings, expanding their repertoire and helping them become more adaptable.
It also can be used to make players less predictable in professional settings, making them less predicatable and less vulnerable to counter-strategies. Grandmasters like Magnus Carlsen already use apps like this.
The app offers three main features: a Randomizer that generates a random opening move, a Learn function to explore available chess openings, and a Help section to guide users through the app.
